# Logan Morro's Portfolio Page

    I've created three HTML pages linked to each other using BootStrap and CSS.

    The pages I've created are:
        1. Home Page (Biography page)
        2. Portfolio Page
        3. Contact Me Page

    To navigate these pages, I used a BootStrap navbar component and modified it to match my page theme.

    My favorite color is teal, and my college school colors were teal/black/gold/white. This is how I arrived on the color theme for my page. I implemented this theme by using a custom CSS style sheet to go along side the BootStrap code.

    Next I wanted to change the font, so I went ahead and added a custom font to each page from Google Fonts.

    I pre-planned how I wanted my portfolio grid to look before building the page then started mapping out the rows, columns, subrows, and subcolumns to get it going. I struggled at first to get the images in a functioning, responsive grid on my portfolio page. I took a few hours and asked a few different resources for resolutions and eventually got it working properly.
